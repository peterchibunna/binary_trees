# binary_trees

# 0. 
Write a function that creates a binary tree node
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 0-node`

# 1. 
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 1-main.c 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 1-left`

# 2.
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
``

# 3
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree
Compile using `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 3-main.c 3-binary_tree_delete.c 0-binary_tree_node.c 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c -o 3-del`
Test for memory leaks: if tree was completely deleted `valgrind ./3-del`

# 4
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c 4-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c -o 4-leaf`

# 5
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 5-binary_tree_is_root.c 5-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c -o 5-root`

# 6
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 6-main.c 6-binary_tree_preorder.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 6-pre`

# 7
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 7-main.c 7-binary_tree_inorder.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 7-in`

# 8
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 8-main.c 8-binary_tree_postorder.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 8-post`
